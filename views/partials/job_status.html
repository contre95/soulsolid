<!-- This template is currently not in use but the idea, is that if at some point we want to display the active jobs somewhere in the app in all sections
we could do something like {{template "job_status" .}} in main.html, for example and we will be able to see them.-->
{{define "job_status"}}
  <div id="app-status" 
       hx-get="/ui/jobs/active" 
       hx-trigger="load, jobStarted from:body, every 5s" 
       hx-target="this" 
       hx-swap="innerHTML">
  </div>
{{end}}
